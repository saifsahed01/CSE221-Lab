- Enable file name extension view in file explorer.

- Read the problem statement from "_200_Task.txt".
    - Find the input/output formats and their examples.
    - Find the scoring distribution and constraints and time limit and hints.
- Find the forbidden keywords from "_200_Forbidden.txt".

- Write your code in "Solution.cpp" or "Solution.java" or "Solution.py".
    - Do not use any of the forbidden keywords in your code.
    - Do not use any external library (such as numpy) in your code.
    - Write your code in a way such that it takes input only from stdin and
        gives output only to stdout.
    - Write your code in a way such that it exits with a return code of 0 after
        all operations are finished.
- Do not edit any of the other given files.

- Run "_200_Checker.bat" to check the tentative score of your solution.
    - One of the ways to run this file is from a terminal using the command
        ".\_000_Checker.bat" (after changing to the correct directory).
    - After running this file a tentative score is given in a range of 0 to 1.
    - If your new score is the same as or better than previous best score then
        "_200_00000000.cpp" or "_200_00000000.java" or "_200_00000000.py" is
        updated automatically with your best solution.
        - If you are not satisfied with the code in this file for some reason
            then you can delete it and generate a new one at your own risk.
            But do not edit this file.
        - The scores given during lab quiz are tentative. The actual scores are
            revealed later after checking the solution of everyone in
            centralized computers.
    - If you receive a non-accepting verdict in some batch of test cases then
        you might find the inputs for some of such batches in "WrongAnswer.txt"
        or "TimeLimitExceeded.txt" or "RunTimeError.txt" to help you correct
        your mistakes and/or improve your solution. You can delete these
        generated files if you want.
- Do not delete any of the given files.
